# Password-Generator

This project includes html, css, and javascript files that together create a password generator that delivers a final password of between 8-120 characters. 

Users are prompted to include special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and/or numbers, and to input a number into the prompt field.

This project practiced event listeners, function expressions, do/while loops, if/if else/else statements, alerts, prompts, and DOM methods.

## Appearance

This project was completed as part of the fall 2020 MSU/Trilogy 6-month bootcamp, so I’ve included an anodyne display (index.html) for grading purposes. 

I’ve also included a version (halloweenGeocitiesPasswordGenerator.html) gwith a different appearance to liven things up. (It’s almost October.) The html file name gives some hints as to the visual theme. 

### Original Assignment

03 JavaScript: Password Generator
Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
If you are unfamiliar with special characters, take a look at some examples.
